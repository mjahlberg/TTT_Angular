TTT_Angular
===========

Created a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and Angular JS.

The game is compatible with Firebase and enables users to play from two different remote computers. 

This was my first real project working with front end work in web development and was Project 1 of WDI at General Assembly.
