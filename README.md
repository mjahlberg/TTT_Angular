TTT_Angular
===========

Created a simple Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, Firebase and Angular JS.

The game is compatible with Firebase and enables users to play from two different remote computers. This was also the first time we began to have a database for our work where we could record our activity.

This was my first real project working with front end work in web development and was Project 1 of WDI at General Assembly.
